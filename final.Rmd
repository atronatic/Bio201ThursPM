Load Data

```{r include=FALSE}
all_data_indv <- read_delim("C:/Users/moonl/Desktop/Bio201ThursPM/final_project_data/DB_v_0.08/DB_v_0.08/all_data_indv.txt", 
    "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
